CMake Deprecation Warning:
  Support for "Extra Generators" like

    CodeBlocks

  is deprecated and will be removed from a future version of CMake.  IDEs may
  use the cmake-file-api(7) to view CMake-generated project build trees.


CMake Warning (dev) at extern/boost/CMakeLists.txt:5 (find_package):
  Policy CMP0144 is not set: find_package uses upper-case <PACKAGENAME>_ROOT
  variables.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0144" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  CMake variable BOOST_ROOT is set to:

    /usr/include/boost

  For compatibility, find_package is ignoring the variable, but code in a
  .cmake module might still use it.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

Boost version: 1.86.0
Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS: /usr/local/include
Boost_LIBRARY_DIRS: /usr/local/lib
Boost_LIBRARIES: Boost::system
CMake Error at extern/CMakeLists.txt:5 (add_subdirectory):
  The source directory

    /Users/liu/Documents/code/c++/ws/extern/jsoncpp
