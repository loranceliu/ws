#### Description
- This is a WebSocket event dispatch framework developed in C++, designed not only for AI front-end and back-end interactions but also integrated with a thread pool mechanism to enhance performance and concurrency handling. By utilizing a thread pool, the framework efficiently processes a large number of concurrent events, avoiding the overhead of frequently creating and destroying threads. This ensures real-time performance and low latency, while improving the system's scalability and stability. In handling complex AI tasks, the framework better allocates computational resources, ensuring efficient event dispatch and response.
